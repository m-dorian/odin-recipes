    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>A cheeseburger, but better.</p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul> 
        <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li> 
        <li>⅓ pound ground beef</li> 
        <li>1 pinch salt</li> 
        <li>4 processed cheese singles (such as Kraft®)</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing (such as Kraft®)</li> 
        <li>1 slice tomato</li> 
        <li>1 leaf lettuce</li> 
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>Steps</h4> 
    <ol> 
        <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast both halves of the hamburger bun, cut sides down, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.</li> 
        <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties over and immediately place two slices of American cheese on each one. Cook until meat has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li> 
        <li>Assemble the double cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.</li>
